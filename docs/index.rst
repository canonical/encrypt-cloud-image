encrypt-cloud-image
===================

encrypt-cloud-image provides tooling for provisioning cloud images for use in
confidential VMs.

It provides functionality for integrity protecting the rootfs of a given image
using dm-verity, encrypting the rootfs and binding the decryption process to
a specific TPM using a profile which describes the state that the system must
be in in order to decrypt the key.

This is meant to be used either as part of a CVM provisioning pipeline by
a cloud provider or to locally produce pre-encrypted golden images so that
they can be deployed directly to the cloud.
